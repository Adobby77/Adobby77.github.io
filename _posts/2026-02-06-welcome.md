## Welcome

Here, I document my study process, summarize key papers, and organize mathematical concepts that I encounter during my research.

### Research Interests

My primary interest lies in the theoretical foundations of **Control Theory** and **Optimization**. 
I am particularly fascinated by how rigorous mathematical structures—such as graph theory and distance geometry—can be applied to solve complex control problems.

You will mostly find posts related to:
* **Control & Optimization**: Optimal control, Distributed optimization...
* **Mathematics**: Distance Geometry...
* **Foundations**: Basic definitions on Linear Algebra, Linear systems,...


Please note that **all notes on this site are continuously updated**.

I hope these notes can be of help to others traversing similar paths in mathematics and engineering.
